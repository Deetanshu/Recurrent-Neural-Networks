# Recurrent-Neural-Networks
Recurrent Neural Networks of different datasets.
I have implemented a set of RNNs and LSTMs that were trained on the Harry Potter Series by JK Rowling. The networks were implemented using
Keras and Tensorflow version 1.8.0
The tokenizer files are the dataset split into tokens, sequences that are learnt by the networks.
